# Zort-main

## Zort, A trading Platform.

### Description
I was asked to make necessary changes to the code to improve the ui.
Upon Completion and previewing them the vercel.app link, they claimed that the image quality was too low.
They were the ones who provided the images.

After a few days, they deleted the chats from Telegram For All

I can't guarantee anything, whether the person who contacted me were officially the company, or a freelancer who was gonna reach out to them with the new design.
